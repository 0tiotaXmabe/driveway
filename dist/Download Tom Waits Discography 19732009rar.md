Tom Waits was born in Pomona, California, in 1949, to schoolteachers Alma Fern Johnson and Jesse Frank Waits[^2^]. He grew up listening to the music of Bob Dylan, Ray Charles, Frank Sinatra, and Louis Armstrong. He was also influenced by the Beat Generation writers, especially Jack Kerouac and Charles Bukowski. He began singing and playing guitar in his teens, and moved to San Diego in 1968, where he performed in coffeehouses and bars. He also worked as a dishwasher, a pizza chef, a doorman, and a cab driver[^3^].
 
In 1972, he moved to Los Angeles and signed a contract with Asylum Records. His first album, Closing Time (1973), featured his distinctive voice and piano-based songs that blended folk, jazz, and blues. He gained critical acclaim and a cult following with his subsequent albums, such as The Heart of Saturday Night (1974), Small Change (1976), Blue Valentine (1978), and Heartattack and Vine (1980). His songs often depicted the lives of the urban underclass, such as alcoholics, prostitutes, criminals, and loners. He also wrote songs for other artists, such as the Eagles, Bruce Springsteen, and Rod Stewart[^1^].
 
In 1980, he married Kathleen Brennan, a script editor whom he met while working on the soundtrack for Francis Ford Coppola's film One from the Heart (1981). He also appeared in several of Coppola's films, such as The Outsiders (1983), Rumble Fish (1983), The Cotton Club (1984), and Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992). He also acted in other films by directors such as Jim Jarmusch, Terry Gilliam, Robert Altman, and David Lynch[^3^].
  
Tom Waits has received many awards and honors for his musical achievements. He has won two Grammy Awards: one for Best Alternative Music Album for Bone Machine (1992), and one for Best Contemporary Folk Album for Mule Variations (1999). He has also been nominated for several other Grammys, including Best Male Rock Vocal Performance, Best Solo Rock Vocal Performance, and Best Alternative Music Album. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2011, where he was praised as \"one of the most original and influential artists of our time\". He has also received a Special Volpi Cup at the Venice Film Festival in 1993, along with the cast of Short Cuts (1993), a film directed by Robert Altman based on the stories of Raymond Carver, in which Waits played a limousine driver.
 
Tom Waits has also been recognized for his contributions to film music. He composed the score for Francis Ford Coppola's One from the Heart (1981), which earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Song Score. He also collaborated with Coppola on several other films, such as The Outsiders (1983), Rumble Fish (1983), The Cotton Club (1984), and Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992). He also wrote songs for other films, such as Ironweed (1987), Night on Earth (1991), Dead Man Walking (1995), and Shrek 2 (2004). He also composed music for two musicals with Robert Wilson and William S. Burroughs: The Black Rider (1990) and Alice (1992). One of his songs, \"You Can Never Hold Back Spring\", was nominated for a David di Donatello Award for Best Song in 2006, for its use in Roberto Benigni's film La tigre e la neve (2005).
